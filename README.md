# Analysis of Migration Discourse in the Media using Computational Linguistics

This repository contain the code used to create a final report (`geographic_analysis_immigration_discourse.pdf`) for Matthew Denny's PPOL628 - Text as Data: Computational Linguistics for Social Sciences course in Spring 2021. I was interested in whether or not the source or destination region of immigration would affect the discourse surrounding the immigrants, particularly in the news media, and wanted to use Natural Language Processing techniques to explore this question.

I used a corpus I collected of nearly 11,000 news articles and accompanying metadata (author, date, etc.) downloaded from ProQuest. These articles were associated with English-language keywords "migrant", "immigrant", "immigration", "migration", and "border." Since the articles were downloaded as text files containing 500 articles each, I needed to split the text files into individual articles (`split_data.py`) and extract the article text and metadata (`Read_Initial_Corpus.R`) into a single dataframe. (The text files themselves are not included in this repo.) I then created cleaned the text further and created regional variables based on the presence of location keywords in the metadata, and visualized the results in an exploratory analysis (`clean_preprocess_viz.R.R`).

Finally, I ran 11 logistic regression models to attempt to predict these regional variables (see the `supervised_models` directory), and use cosine similarity to compute the top-weighted terms from each regional model. These top-weighted terms tended to be similar for regions that are more closely linked geopolitically, and different for regions with a large immigration corridor, such as the US and Mexico.
